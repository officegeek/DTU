# Excel Power Query



Excel Power Query is one of the most powerful new features within Microsoft Excel and the easiest to learn.

It was first introduced as an Excel add-in in 2013 and was then made available in Excel 2010.

In Excel 2016 it was renamed to Get & Transform and was available (without using an add-in) under the DATA tab in the ribbon menu.
In Excel 2019, it will be renamed to Power Query once again!

You can use Power Query to clean & transform your data that you download from your ERP or accounting system and display it in a report for Excel to work with.

The best thing is that you can reapply the same transformation steps in just ONE single click, saving you HOURS! So next week when you get the same report with updated data, a simple REFRESH will transform your data once again!
